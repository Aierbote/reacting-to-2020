# Reacting To 2020
> Gamified React Tutorial

Can't stand those boring react tutorials in which you click away after 5 minutes? Have no fear, Reacting To 2020 is here! This is a Gamified React tutorial that walks you through major events that happened in 2020.

## Purpose

The value that gamification brings in is summarized very effectively in the following statement as per Wikipedia:

> Gamification techniques are intended to leverage peopleâ€™s natural desires for socializing, learning, mastery, competition, achievement, status, self-expression, altruism or closure. Gamification strategies use rewards for players who accomplish desired tasks or competition to engage players. Types of rewards include points, achievement badges or levels, the filling of a progress bar or providing the user with virtual currency. Making the rewards for accomplishing tasks visible to other players or providing leaderboards are ways of encouraging players to compete.

## Installing / Getting started

A quick introduction to get the app up & running:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/songeunyou/reacting-to-2020/
npm install
npm start
```

This clones our repository, installs the necessary dependencies and runs the React app in a development server!

### Building for Production

Heres how to build the app for production:

```shell
npm run build
```

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance, and outputs to the 'build' folder
